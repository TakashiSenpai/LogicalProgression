    // descriptions
    #LOC_LP_efficientPropulsion_description = What if we made the engine bells longer? Well, here we are, with a set of efficient vacuum engines.
    #LOC_LP_highEfficiencyPropulsion_description = Our engineers have combined the mindset of bigger is better and have delivered a new set of engines, that will propel you further than ever before.
    #LOC_LP_higherEfficiencyPropulsion_description = At this rate, one starts to wonder how powerful the vacuum technology can get.
    #LOC_LP_veryHighEfficiencyPropulsion_description = When everybody thought it couldn't get better, R&D gave us these engines. We might need to investigate in order to stop this rapid technology progression!
    #LOC_LP_tremendousEfficiencyPropulsion_description = At this point you should reconsider why you would even need such big and powerful vacuum engines. Space is the limit!
  
    #LOC_LP_basicLogistics_description = We might need more Kerbals to move all these boxes. Jeb, did you pack more Snacks again?
    #LOC_LP_specializedLogistics_description = Nothing stops us anymore from being an intergalactic transport magnate!

    #LOC_LP_advElectronics_description = 1.21 GigaWatts needed to advance into the future. Might require a thunderstorm upon startup.
    #LOC_LP_specializedElectronics_description = A lot of fuzes and transistors, we don't even know what they do anymore.
    #LOC_LP_experimentalElectronics_description = What does the big red button do?

    #LOC_LP_basicColonization_description = New technologies for attempting to establish permanent presence on new Worlds.
